3) User is prompted with "From the list above, what is the ID of the product you want to buy?" User is only allowed to input a numerical value .. if they enter a value that is not a number the program will not go any further.

4) Once user answers the first prompt, they are prompted with a second question .. "How many would you like to purchase?" Again, the user is only able to input a numercal value otherwise the program will not go any further.

5) I could not figure out how to take the user input and query against the database - and then further subtract the user quantity input from the database. Here is my psuedo code for the logic to finish the program.
